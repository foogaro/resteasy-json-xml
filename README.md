=================

This project aims to explain how to use RESTeasy 1.2.1.GA with JBoss EAP 5.1.2 when you deal with @Form and @FormParam.
                                        =================      ===============                    =====     ==========
Also you will find how to use URL-based content negotation to retrieve data in the format you like.

Soon I'll code the same project using RESTeasy 2.
                                      ==========
What you need is:
-----------------

 * Maven 2+
 * JDK 5+
 * JBoss EAP 5.1.2 or JBoss AS 6
 * The IDE you like, preferably a good one. Any IDEA out there? ;-)
