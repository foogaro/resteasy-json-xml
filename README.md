resteasy-json-xml
=================

This project aims to explain how to use __RESTeasy 1.2.1.GA__ with __JBoss EAP 5.1.2__ when you deal with __@Form__ and __@FormParam__.

Also you will find how to use URL-based content negotation to retrieve data in the format you like.

Soon I'll code the same project using __RESTeasy 2__.

What you need is:
-----------------

 * Maven 2+
 * JDK 5+
 * JBoss EAP 5.1.2 or JBoss AS 6
 * The IDE you like, preferably a good one. Any __IDEA__ out there? ;-)

Why am I sharing this?
----------------------

I'm sure I'll need that soon or later!
